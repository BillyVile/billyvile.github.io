			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="me.jpg" alt="Billy Vile">
            <div class="introduction">
                <p>I am currently in my second year of a <span class="gold">Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced)</span> program at The University of Adelaide, and I aspire to become a Software Engineer.</p>
                <p>I have a <span class="gold">passion for tackling difficult challenges and utilising my problem-solving skills</span>. This aligns well with my primary interest in computer science, which involves developing and designing efficient solutions to complex problems. Additionally, I have a personal interest in psychology, which, combined with my interest in coding, fuels my curiosity and fascination with the world of <span class="gold">artificial intelligence</span>. In my opinion, designing the perfect AI system requires a strong understanding of both psychology and philosophy.</p>
                <p>In the realm of business, I am particularly interested in finance and trading. One of my personal coding projects is a <span class="gold">live trading bot written in Python</span>. I am also passionate about economics and am committed to expanding my knowledge and understanding of finance. To this end, I have taken several business <span class="gold">finance courses</span> as electives throughout my degree.</p>
                <p>In my leisure time, I enjoy playing soccer and visiting some of the world's best beaches. I am a dedicated supporter of <span class="gold">Manchester United</span> and regularly participate in soccer events. I am also a sociable person and enjoy being <span class="gold">involved in my community</span>. I play lawn bowls every Thursday with a diverse group of individuals including former teachers, supervisors, friends, family, and colleagues. Additionally, I work at a local winery, where I serve customers as a bartender and waiter. Music is another one of my passions and I frequently attend live music events. My<span class="gold"> favourite bands</span> include Arctic Monkeys, Idles, The Killers, and The Beatles.</p>
				<p>In terms of personal characteristics, I have a span <span class="gold">love for learning,</span> I am personable, <span class="gold">hardworking,</span> logical, and <span class="gold">confident.</span> Some of my friends may describe me as stubborn. I disagree. There are not many things that I dislike, however, some include: Jump scares, stubbing my toe, Liverpool, and forgetting semicolons.</p>
				<p>In terms of programming, I love tackling all sorts of complex problems, from designing <span class="gold">OOP games in C++</span> to data analysis in Python to <span class="gold">web-development</span> and trading bots. My favourite language is C++, but I also have experience with C, Python and JavaScript.</p>
